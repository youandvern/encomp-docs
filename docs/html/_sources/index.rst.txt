Learn about how to use Efficalc Cloud
=====================================

This documentation site includes all of the important details about how to use and take full 
advantage of Efficalc's powerful calculation building features through the cloud hosted website.

What is Efficalc Cloud?
-----------------------

Efficalc Cloud is a comprehensive, cloud-based engineering calculation platform that extends the 
core functionalities of the open-source Efficalc library. Designed for structural engineers and 
professionals, Efficalc Cloud provides an enhanced, collaborative environment to run, modify, and 
deploy engineering calculations with greater efficiency and flexibility.

For information about the open-source efficalc library,

* See the documentation at https://youandvern.github.io/efficalc
* View the github repo at: https://github.com/youandvern/efficalc


How is Efficalc Cloud different from the Efficalc library?
----------------------------------------------------------

As of now, Efficalc Cloud has full access to all the features the library version has, plus these extra benefits:

* **Cloud-based calculations:** access, edit, or create new calculations from any computer or device at any time.
* **Calculation Design Pages:** once you write an efficalc calculation, the cloud platform automates a custom design page to easily use that calculation template for as many unique designs as you need.
* **No Python environment setup:** the online template editor let's you write your python-based efficalc calculations without ever needing to set up a local environment on your computer.


Efficalc Cloud is still developing, as is the library, so stay tuned for regular updates and new features!


Efficalc Cloud Design Portal
----------------------------

As mentioned above, a major feature of using calculations in the Efficalc Cloud is the design portal that is automatically created for each of your efficalc calculations. Numerous examples of this portal can be seen in the following sections:

* :ref:`next-steps`
* :ref:`examples`
